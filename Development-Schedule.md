# Rollout 1: Estimated release Early June 2017

## Primary Components

Rollout 1 will be the first significant release of HAPI technologies. It will include the Smart Module software and hardware including: Auto-discovery, Scheduling, Alerts. Five sensor types will be supported. Basic cloud-based analytics will be deployed using [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

### OBJECTIVES

* Deploy an open source, production-level sensing, alerting and analytics capability
* Create awareness of the project in order to attract potential contributors and partners

# Rollout 2: Estimated release Mid-July 2017

## Primary Components

In rollout 2 we will release an Android App (Facility Management System) that users can employ to configure smart modules, manage their facility schedule, set/check alerts, view current sensor readings and toggle power controls.

A line of 110V, 240V and 12V power controller Smart Modules will be released.

4 new sensors types will be add, primarily focused on security.

An optional solar panel unit will be developed that will allow users to power their Smart Modules using solar power.

Support for ESP-based Modules will be released to provide for lower cost “dumb” modules and greater communications flexibility.

### OBJECTIVES

* Deploy power control modules that allow users to manage facility functions in response to sensor readings, scheduling and user demand.
* Extend platform usability through greater flexibility for powering modules
* Give the user a viable management tool (FMS) that we can promote in the Google Play Store

# Rollout 3: Estimated release Late-August 2017

## Primary Components

We’ll be releasing an off-the-shelf component to provide for WiFi extension with a goal of enabling HAPI implementations to connect to existing WiFi networks up to 400m away.

Level controllers capable of sensing levels (fluid, pH, temperature, etc) and then activating controls to maintain levels within user-defined thresholds will be developed.

Designs for out first Sustainability Appliance, the Solar Food Dehydrator, will be released.

Support for approximately 3 new sensor types.

### OBJECTIVES

* Extend platform usability through greater data communications range
* Provide a solid platform for managing site assets such as pumps, lights, valves.
* Deliver a zero-footprint appliance for dehydrating food products

# Rollout 4: Estimated release Mid-October 2017

## Primary Components

Data communications ranges will be further extended through the implementation of a cellular modem interface. This will effectively give Smart Modules a global range wherever cellular signals exist.

Two new Sustainability Appliances will be released. The Solar Thermal Unit (STU) can be used to provide zero-footprint heat, venting and limited cooling. The Multi-stage Water Filter will provide zero-footprint water filtration capabilities

### OBJECTIVES

* This rollout will extend growing seasons and expand the geographical range of sustainable controlled-environment agriculture through the development of the STU.
* Facility feasibility and food safety will be increased through the production of clean water.
* The geographical range/potential of food production facilities will be expanded through increased data communications capabilities.

# Rollout 5: Estimated release Mid-December 2017

## Primary Components

Three new Sustainability Appliances will be released. The desiccant-based dehumidifier will allow users to manage humidity in a facility while providing some control over the timing of expending energy to reclaim captured water. A solar still/snow melt appliance will provide users with the ability to produce water from snow as well as heat water for energy and food safety purposes. The zero-footprint Atmospheric Water Generator will allow users to pull humidity from ambient air, thereby extending the feasibility of controlled-environment agriculture to more geographic regions.

The Growing Management System will allow users to generate production plans based on customer demands, nutritional demands or the minimization of energy and/or water requirements.

### OBJECTIVES

* Finalize HAPI Series 1 as a robust and flexible foundation for zero-footprint agriculture and pave the way for intelligent control and planning applications. Provide multiple, sustainable water solutions to increase the geographic and seasonal feasibility of food production.
